# Garden Escape: Honey I Shrunk the Coder!

Garden Escape: Honey I Shrunk the Coder! is a fun choose-your-own adventure story game where you play the role of a tiny software developer who has to make a series of key decisions to choose the direction of the narrative and try to survive until the end of the story.

Can you fight your way through your jungle-sized garden, past giant creepy crawlies and garden tools back to the safety of your kitchen? Choose from the options presented to you as you progress through the story and follow the prompts on screen to see if you can make it home and escape the garden.

The story includes references that will appeal to developers, but is equally fun and easy to understand if you have no coding experience at all.

This terminal-based project is coded in Python and is designed to view on a laptop / desktop computer screen. It will not display correctly on a mobile.

The live site can be found here: https://garden-escape-185db543c454.herokuapp.com/

## Features

### Game Title (title.py)

***Title Text***

- 'Garden Escape' displayed in large text to provide clear heading to mark the beginning of the story and to give an impression of a big adventure ahead. 
- Colour red used to indicate danger and risk
- 'Honey I Shrunk the Coder!' in default font, but with spacing between letters to stand out from regular text and appear larger to work visually alongside main title text.
- 'Garden Escape' text created using [pyfiglet 1.0.2](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/) library imported from Python Package Index (PyPI) with ['slant'](http://www.figlet.org/examples.html) font. 
- Red text colour created using [Colorama 0.4.6](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) library imported from PyPI.

***ASCII Art***
- A garden themed strip of ASCII art to help set the scene alongside the title text.
- Different coloured output created using Coloramaâ€™s constant shorthand for ANSI escape sequences.

***Enter Name: input()***
- The player is invited to enter a name for their story character.
- The name must be at least 1 character long, but less than 16 characters so it fits in the final congratulations window at the end of the story.
- The entered name is passed through validation function validate_player_name() and if it does not pass validation then an error message is displayed to the player with a prompt to try again.
- The error message is in red text to highlight that there is problem that needs attention.

- GitPod Problems
    - No problems detected within the Gitpod Garden-Escape workspace

### Unfixed Bugs

- On occassion there is some residual code from the title text or ascii art that is not cleared by the os.system("clear") function. This issue is inconsistent and does not affect the user experience as it is not visible unless the player chooses to scroll up on the terminal window. I have not been able to identify a reason for this issue, but as it does not impact the intended functionality and use of the program I have kept the title text and ascii art in the program.
- No other bugs.

## Deployment

### Gitpod Version Control
This site was created using the Gitpod cloud development environment before being pushed through to a dedicated repository on Github.

The following commands were used througout development to push the code through to the Github repo:

- **git add .** - This command was used to add any tracked files to the staging area.
- **git commit -m "Commit message."** - This command was used to create a snapshot of the staged area with a short description.
- **git push** - This command was used to push the committed changes from the current branch to the remote repository on Github.

### Deployment

The finished program was initially hosted within a repository on Github, and then this Github repository was connected with Heroku, the site through which the final project was deployed.

***How to Deploy to Heroku***

The steps to deploy to Heroku are as follows:

### Content

***Data Model***

- [Portal Hunt](https://github.com/JackLamb99/portal-hunt/) by Jack Lamb was referred to as an example of how to structure the story narrative data (story_text.py) ready to be imported and used in run.py. 

No code was taken from Jack's project, but it was useful for considering a suitable data model. 

***Python***

- The CI walkthrough project 'Love Sandwiches' was used as a reference example when building the error handling functions; validate_player_name() and validate_story_choice()
- A tutorial on [YouTube ' How to create ASCII art text in Python'](https://youtu.be/Y0QiBbI3MWs) was used as guidance on how to import and use pyfiglet library to create the title and game over text
- Guidance on [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/) was used as reference for best practice when writing docstrings
- Guidance on [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/breaking-long-lines-code-python/) was used as reference for breaking up long lines of code to fit within the 80 character constraints 
- A World Class Tech Ed tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8yw9gUJaHo) was used as a reference when creating my own ASCII art
- Guidance on [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clear-screen-python/) was used as reference for how to clear the screen in python using os.system("clear")
- The code in a [StackOverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1254370/reimport-a-module-while-interactive) was adapted to enable the title content to be re-imported if the player chooses to re-start the game.
