Story text for Garden Escape: Honey I Shrunk the Coder!

This module contains all of the story narrative that sets the scene for the player's 
adventure. 

Each block of text has been declared as a variable. As the player chooses different 
options in the story, their choice will identify which variable (and which text) 
should be displayed to the player as they continue on their adventure.

INTRO_TEXT = """
You are working from home on your latest Python terminal project in the garden 
thinking “This is what remote working is all about!” when you receive a 
mysterious email featuring nothing but a big red button inviting you to 'Click Me'.

You know you shouldn't...
But curiosity gets the better of you and you click the button... 

There is a flash and you suddenly find yourself standing amidst gigantic blades of 
grass in a vast jungle filled with towering plants and looming dangers. With no idea 
how it happened, you slowly realise you are still in your garden, but you are no 
bigger than a ladybug!

Thankfully you still have your laptop with you, but there is no wifi.  Your only 
chance is to navigate through this treacherous landscape and get back to your house to 
see if you can find a way to revert to your last save before the dreaded email arrived.
"""

SPIDER_TEXT = """
Determined to make it home and return to your normal size, you take a deep breath and 
cautiously make your way through the 20ft tall grass.

As you climb between some dandelions, you spot a massive spider hanging on a thread, 
swaying gently in the shadows above your head.
"""

SPIDER_OPTION_A = "a) Try to sneak past the spider, hoping it doesn't notice you.\n"

SPIDER_OPTION_B = "b) Create a distraction so you can make a run for it.\n"

SPIDER_OPTION_A_TEXT = """
You carefully manoeuver around the spider, hoping to avoid its notice. However, 
your movement disturbs a nearby web strand, alerting the arachnid to your presence.

You freeze, paralysed in fear as the spider fixes all 8 of its beady eyes on you 
and steadily descends towards you..."""

SPIDER_OPTION_B_TEXT = """
Remembering that you have your laptop with you, you use your coding skills to hack 
into a nearby smart sprinkler via bluetooth, causing water to spray everywhere. 

While the spider is distracted, you run for it and escape into the undergrowth.
"""
NESTED_SPIDER_OPTIONS_TEXT = """
As you watch in transfixed horror, the spider seems to grow twice as large as it 
gets closer and closer. You wish you had time to whip out your laptop and ask 
StackOverflow what to do, but you need to act fast.

Do you:\n"""

SPIDER_OPTION_A2 = "a) Quickly roll out of the way.\n"

SPIDER_OPTION_B2 = "b) Try to reason with the spider.\n"

SPIDER_OPTION_A2_TEXT = """
You roll out of the way just in time, narrowly avoiding the spider's deadly strike. 

Not stopping to check if the spider is in pursuit, you get to your feet and run as 
hard and fast as you can until your chest feels like it's going to burst. 

Looking around, there is no sign of the spider, so you stop to get your breath back. 

Phew - that was close!
"""

SPIDER_OPTION_B2_TEXT = """
Using a combination of hand gestures and drawing in the dirt, you attempt to reason 
with the spider, explaining your situation as a shrunken developer just trying to 
get home. 

Surprisingly, the spider seems to understand and lets you pass unharmed. 

You breathe a sigh of relief and hurry away, vowing that you will never harm a 
spider again when you get back to normality."""

CENTIPEDE_STORY_TEXT = """
Having made it past the spider, you feel pretty good about your progress, but you 
are getting hungry. You think dreamily of your stash of trail mix and chocolate 
buttons that keep you going through those long hours of debugging, and wonder if 
you'll ever get to use your 'World's #0 Programmer' mug again.

Lost in your thoughts, you don't notice the movement in the house-sized plant 
pots up ahead.

Suddenly a gigantic centipede as long as a street lamp scuttles out from behind 
your favourite glazed blue pot. You watch in terror as it meanders fluidly around 
some pebbles and stops directly in your path.
"""

CENTIPEDE_OPTIONS_TEXT = """
Your heart pounding with adrenaline, you square up against the centipede, ready 
to defend yourself. It hisses menacingly and raises the front of its body to
loom above you, its numerous legs poised to strike...

Do you:
"""

CENTIPEDE_OPTION_A = "a) Attempt to outmaneuver it with your agility.\n"
CENTIPEDE_OPTION_B = "b) Search for a nearby object to use as a weapon.\n"

CENTIPEDE_OPTION_A_TEXT= """
You weave left and right before darting between its legs, but the centipede 
has lightning-fast reflexes and as it traps you in its claws, you feel your body 
stiffen as the venom enters your bloodstream. 

The last thing you see is a pair of mandibles reaching hungrily towards your face.

Better luck next time!
"""

CENTIPEDE_OPTION_B_TEXT= """
You look around frantically for something you can use as a weapon against the 
centipede. 

Remembering your laptop, you open it up and turn the screen brightness
up to blinding, thrusting it towards the centipede's head and shouting at the 
top of your voice. 

Startled by the sudden movements, noise and bright light, the centipede slinks 
away, allowing you to pass.
