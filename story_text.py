You are working from home on your latest Python terminal project in the garden 
thinking “This is what remote working is all about!” when you receive a 
mysterious email featuring nothing but a big red button inviting you to 'Click Me'.

You know you shouldn't, but curiosity gets the better of you and you click the button… 

There is a flash and you suddenly find yourself standing amidst gigantic blades of 
grass in a vast garden filled with towering plants and looming dangers. With no idea 
how it happened, you slowly realise you must be no bigger than a ladybug!

Thankfully you still have your laptop with you, but there is no wifi.  Your only chance 
is to navigate through this treacherous landscape and get back to your house to see 
if you can find a way to revert to your last save before the dreaded email arrived.

Determined to return to your normal size, you take a deep breath and cautiously make
your way through the grass.

As you climb over a dandelion patch, you spot a massive spider lurking in the shadows.
