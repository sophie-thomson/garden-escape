Story text for Garden Escape: Honey I Shrunk the Coder!

This module contains all of the story narrative that sets the scene for the player's 
adventure. 

Each block of text has been declared as a variable. As the player chooses different 
options in the story, their choice will identify which variable (and which text) 
should be displayed to the player as they continue on their adventure.

INTRO_TEXT = """
You are working from home on your latest Python terminal project in the garden 
thinking “This is what remote working is all about!” when you receive a 
mysterious email featuring nothing but a big red button inviting you to 'Click Me'.

You know you shouldn't, but curiosity gets the better of you and you click the button… 

There is a flash and you suddenly find yourself standing amidst gigantic blades of 
grass in a vast garden filled with towering plants and looming dangers. With no idea 
how it happened, you slowly realise you must be no bigger than a ladybug!

Thankfully you still have your laptop with you, but there is no wifi.  Your only 
chance is to navigate through this treacherous landscape and get back to your house to 
see if you can find a way to revert to your last save before the dreaded email arrived.

SPIDER_TEXT = """
Determined to return to your normal size, you take a deep breath and cautiously make
your way through the grass.

As you climb over a dandelion patch, you spot a massive spider lurking in the shadows.

SPIDER_OPTION_A_TEXT = """
You carefully maneuver around the spider, hoping to avoid its notice. However, 
your movement disturbs a nearby web strand, alerting the arachnid to your presence.

It lunges towards you!"""

SPIDER_OPTION_B_TEXT = """
Remembering that you have your laptop with you, you use your coding skills to hack 
into a nearby smart sprinkler via bluetooth, causing water to spray everywhere. 

While the spider is distracted, you run for it and escape into the undergrowth.

You roll out of the way just in time, narrowly avoiding the spider's deadly strike. 

You continue on your journey, heart pounding with adrenaline.
"""

SPIDER_OPTION_B2_TEXT = """
Using a combination of hand gestures and drawing in the dirt, you attempt to reason 
with the spider, explaining your situation as a shrunken developer just trying to 
get home. 

Surprisingly, the spider seems to understand and lets you pass unharmed. 

You breathe a sigh of relief and move forward."""
